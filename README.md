## TODO

- Include a general market for ReR when there is a non-existing market
- Work on the input errors:
  - Detect unit errors in the template 
  - Detect missing rows
- Work on assistant functions or classes:
  - Since the filling of the base-file is a time expansive task, create some classes that allow to fill faster that file
